This is a GRPC documentation of my endpoint and how to make a sample request.
1. Generatig python gRPC two libraies services
2. App Udaconnect Protobuf definitions
3. Service sample request 


1. Generatig python gRPC two libraies services
From proto folder, execute the following command:
python -m grpc_tools.protoc -I ./ --python_out=./ --grpc_python_out=./ connection.proto

after that 2 files Stub and Servicer will be created inside proto folder beside 
connection.proto file and they will be used by importing in models folder.


2. App Udaconnect Protobuf definitions
File name  connection.proto in the following path: 
modules/PersonsAPI/app/udaconnect/proto

The file connection.proto defines messages, obejects and service
    2.1 Objects
        2.1.1 Person object for person data.
        2.1.2 Location object for location data.
    2.2 Messages
        2.2.1 SearchMesg defines data searches for user connection inputs.
        2.2.2 ConnectionMesg defines connection search result between person and location.
        2.2.3 ConnectionMesgList wrappers repeated ConnectionMesg as an array with search results.
    2.3 Service
        2.3.1 ConnectionService is the service endpoint, responsibles for recieving SearchMesg 
        and responding with the correct ConnectionMesgList.
